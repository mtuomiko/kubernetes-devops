# Part 2 

## Exercise 1

pingpong 0.0.3
ticker-server 0.0.3

1. Storage sharing between said apps removed. Pingpong still uses the persistent volume to keep the count, and ticker apps use ephemeral storage to share the uuid/timestamp. 

2. Apply ticker-deployment `kubectl apply -f manifests/ticker/deployment.yml` and pingpong-deployment `kubectl apply -f pingpong/manifests/deployment.yml`

2. Check result `curl -vvv http://localhost:8081/ticker/status`

`{"uuid":"b3f4e403-ec77-11ef-9599-e667d1136709","timestamp":"2025-02-16T15:11:03Z","pingPongCount":14}`

## Exercise 2

todo-app-backend 0.0.8
* actual todo backend api

todo-app-frontend 0.0.3
  * todo-app-frontend-server, http server + image.jpg handling
  * todo-app-frontend-vue, built and copied as static assets into the server

Todo frontend composed of a Vue frontend served by a go gin HTTP server with image.jpg caching.

1. Apply for backend and frontend

```
kubectl apply -f todo-app-backend/manifests/deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f todo-app-frontend/manifests/deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f todo-app-frontend/manifests/service.yml
```

2. Apply for ingress `kubectl apply -f manifests/traefik-ingress.yml`

`/todo` routed to `todo-app-frontend-svc` with /todo prefix stripping. Frontend serves on it's own root, but assets served using a relative base (https://vite.dev/guide/build#relative-base), excluding cached image.jpg which has special handling.

`/todo/api` routed to `todo-app-backend-svc` with /todo/api prefix stripping. Backend serves on /todos. Frontend is configured to a relative API URL /api/todos.

In practice, browser accesses backend on http://localhost:8081/todo/api/todos

3. Check result on http://localhost:8081/todo

Minor hickup with vite, relative asset base isn't working resulting in asset requests to e.g. http://localhost:8081/assets/index-Cr878TA6.js which aren't routed to the frontend.

It does work when using http://localhost:8081/todo/. Good enough for now.

4. And looks like image.jpg caching is working on the frontend server. Otherwise static but after a while `kubectl logs todo-app-frontend-dep-54d7dd4777-kcptw` shows:

```
