## Part 3 exercise 6

## DBaaS (Database as a Service)

### Pros
- nearly turnkey solution: should be relatively straightforward to setup and have less maintenance requirements
- backups inside the service provider's system should be very easy to manage
- can provide increased fault tolerance depending on your DIY solution
### Cons
- expensive as you are paying the service provider for the added simplicity
- possibly unable to control the location of data
- increased dependency on the provider
- limited options if you want to use some obscure DBMS

## DIY solution

### Pros
- possibly cheaper since it can use existing computational resources
- possibly increased control over the location of data
- can be a very customized solution if needed
- not as reliant on any single entity/provider
### Cons
- you are responsible for the actual DBMS: increased setup and maintenance demands (skills and work)
- backup solutions need more attention (skills and work)
